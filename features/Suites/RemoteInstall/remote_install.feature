Feature: Perform remote install
  In order to use SuiteCRM
  As a developer or a tester
  I need to perform a fresh installation

  Scenario: Install successfully SuiteCRM
    Given I am on "/"
    And I check "setup_license_accept"
    And I wait milliseconds "1000"
    And I press "Next"
    And I wait milliseconds "5000"
    And I press "Next"
    And I wait milliseconds "3000"
    When I select "provide" from "dbUSRData"
    And I wait milliseconds "1000"
    And I fill in the following:
      | setup_db_host_name  | mariadb   |
      | setup_db_sugarsales_user  | suitecrm_user   |
      | setup_db_sugarsales_password_entry  | suitecrmuatpass   |
      | setup_db_sugarsales_password_retype_entry  | suitecrmuatpass   |
      | setup_site_admin_password  | admin1234   |
      | setup_site_admin_password_retype  | admin1234   |
      | setup_site_url  | https://crm-server.lan   |
      | email1  | admin@crm-server.lan   |
    And I wait milliseconds "1000"
    And I click on the element "h3" within the element id "fb4"
    And I wait milliseconds "1000"
    And I select "Y-m-d" from "default_date_format"
    And I select "Europe/London" from "timezone"
    And I fill in the following:
      | default_currency_name | British Pounds |
      | default_currency_symbol  | Â£   |
      | default_currency_iso4217  | GBP   |
    And I press "Next"
    And I wait milliseconds "10000"
    Then I should see "is now complete!"
